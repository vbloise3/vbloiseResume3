      "question": "Your company has hired a young and enthusiastic accountant. After reviewing the AWS documentation and usage graphs, he announces that you are wasting vast amounts of money running servers for a full hour instead of spinning them up only when they are needed and down again as soon as they are idle for 1 minute. He cites the AWS claim that you only pay for what you use, and that as a senior engineer, you should be more conscious of wasting company money. &nbsp;How do you respond?",
      "answers": [
        "You leap across the meeting table and slap him for insulting you in front of your peers.",
        "Acknowledge the problem and propose that you could downsize the instances so that the workload over the hour consumes the full instance capacity for the full hour. You might also propose closer monitoring and automation to allow you to up-size and down-size the instance each hour over the day to match the instance performance to the anticipated workload.",
        "You thank him for his concern, and advise him that he has misinterpreted the pricing document: Instances are billed by the full hour, and partial hours are billed as such. Additionally, storage charges are incurred even if the Db instance sits idle. Taking into account productivity losses, stopping and restarting Db instances may actually result in additional costs. As such, your solution is fine as it now stands.",
        "You grudgingly acknowledge his point and change your scheduling and tuning settings."
