      "question": "You're building out a single-region application in us-west-2. However, disaster recovery is a strong consideration, and you need to build the application so that if us-west-2 becomes unavailable, you can fail-over to us-west-1. Your application relies exclusively on pre-built AMI's. In order to share those AMI's with the region you're using as a backup, which process would you follow?",
      "answers": [
        "Create a new instance in us-west-1, making certain the instance in the failover region shares a security group with the instance in the default region.",
        "Copy the AMI from us-west-2, manually apply launch permissions, user-defined tags, and Amazon S3 bucket permissions of the default AMI to the new instance, and launch the instance.",
        "Copy the AMI from us-west-2 to us-west-1 and launch as-is.",
        "Nothing: AMIs are specific to an account, and they can be used anywhere."

      "correctAnswer": ["Copy the AMI from us-west-2, manually apply launch permissions, user-defined tags, and Amazon S3 bucket permissions of the default AMI to the new instance, and launch the instance."]

      "question": "At the monthly product meeting, one of the Product Owners proposes an idea to address an immediate shortcoming of the product system: storing a copy of the customer price schedule in the customer record in the database. You know that you can store large text or binary objects in DynamoDB. You give a tentative OK to do a&nbsp;Minimal Viable Product test, but stipulate that it must comply with the size limitation on the Attribute Name &amp; Value. Which is the correct limitation?",
      "answers": [
        "The Name must not exceed 64 KB and the Value must not exceed 500 KB.",
        "The Name must not exceed 64 KB and the Value must not exceed 400 KB.",
