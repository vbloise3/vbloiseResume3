      "question": "You are designing an application for a furniture retailer. A component of the application takes pictures of the furniture for sale and generates thumb nail images which then need to be stored persistently. The business can tolerate it if some images are lost as they can be regenerated. The thumbnails will need to be retrieved immediately when the application requests them. What is the cheapest option to do this?",

      "question": "You run a website which hosts videos and you have two types of members, premium fee paying members and free members. All videos uploaded by both your premium members and free members are processed by a fleet of EC2 instances which will poll SQS as videos are uploaded. However you need to ensure that your premium fee paying members videos have a higher priority than your free members. How should you design your application.",
      "answers": [
        "SQS allows you to set priorities on individual items within the queue, so simply set the fee paying members at a higher priority than your free members.",
        "Create two SQS queues, one for premium members and one for free members. Program your EC2 fleet to poll the premium queue first and if empty, to then poll your free members SQS queue.",
        "SQS would not be suitable for this scenario. It would be much better to use SNS to encode the videos.",
        "SQS operates on a First In, First Out process. Design your application so that premium members are sent to the SQS queue first."
