      "question": "Following advice from your consultant, you have&nbsp;configured your VPC to use Dedicated&nbsp;hosting tenancy. A subsequent change to your application has rendered the performance gains from dedicated tenancy superfluous, and you would now like to recoup some of these greater costs. How do you revert to Default hosting tenancy?",

      "question": "Your company has just purchased another company. As part of the merger, your team has been instructed to cross connect the corporate networks. You run all your confidential corporate services and Internal DNS in a VPC. The merged company has all their confidential corporate services and Internal DNS on-premises. After establishing a Direct-Connect service between your VPC and their on-premise network, and confirming all the routing, firewalls, and authentication, you find that while you can resolve names against their DNS, the other company services is unable to resolve names against your DNS servers. Why might this be?",
      "answers": [
        "AWS Route53 is an Internet service, and the other company needs to do lookups and zone transfers via the Internet, not the Direct-Connect link.",
        "You cannot use DNS in this way. You need to merge the zones under a parent zone registered with ICANN.",
        "By design, AWS DNS does not respond to requests originating from outside the VPC.",
        "Route53 is not an industry standard DNS service, and zone transfers and name resolution must be done via a proprietary API.",
