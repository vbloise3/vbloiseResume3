      "question": "You have been engaged by a company to design and lead a migration to an AWS environment. The team is concerned about the capabilities of the new environment, especially when it comes to avoiding bottlenecks. The design calls for about 20 instances (C3.2xLarge) pulling jobs/messages from SQS. Network traffic per instance is estimated to be around 500 Mbps at the beginning and end of each job. Which network configuration should you plan on deploying?",
      "answers": [
        "Deploy as a Placement Group as the aggregated burst traffic could be around 10 Gbps.",
        "Activate EBS-Optimization on the instance to maximize network throughput.",
        "Use a 2nd Network Interface to separate the SQS traffic for the storage traffic.",
        "Spread the Instances over multiple AZs to minimize the traffic concentration and maximise the fault tolerance.",
        "Choose a different instance type that better matched the traffic demand."

        "To ask the development team to implement a checksum algorithm to confirm that the data is consistent across all the AZs.",
        "To ask the development team to code for strongly consistent reads. As the consultant, you will advise the CTO of the increased cost.",

      "answers": [
        "Yes: VPC Peering is designed to route traffic between the VPCs.",

      "question": "You manage a Ruby on Rails application that lives on a cluster of EC2 instances. Your website occasionally experiences brief, strong, and entirely unpredictable spikes in traffic that overwhelm your EC2 instances' resources and freeze the application. As a result, you're losing recently submitted requests from end users. You use Auto Scaling to deploy additional resources to handle the load during spikes, but the new instances don't spin-up fast enough to prevent the existing application servers from freezing. Which of the following will provide the most cost-effective solution in preventing the loss of recently submitted requests?",
      "answers": [
        "Ask AWS support to pre-warm the Elastic Load Balancer.",
